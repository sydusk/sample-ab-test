# Sample A/B test

This notebook uses toy data to simulate an actual A/B test on conversion rates. 

Student T, Mann Whitney U, and Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests are used to test the significance of the difference between the A and B group means. Confidence intervals for the difference in group means are calculated and visualized.
